## stream_startup_void_stranger.au3

Quickly get set up for [Void Stranger](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2121980/Void_Stranger), including getting some intro music running + loading/sizing mspaint and getting a green background going so I can draw over the game (window capture + chroma key).

In order it:

1. Loads, sizes, and positions MSPaint.
2. Sets right-click to be a chroma-keyable freen color and flood fills the canvas.
3. Sets left-click to be a yellowish color and sets a larger brush size.
4. Loads discord
5. Opens a folder with Void Stranger screenshots.tracks.
6. Loads VLC with a few choice Void Stranger 
7. Loads my chat bot in visual studio and starts the bot.
8. Loads, sizes, and positions Chrome with tabs for my dashboard, channel point redemptions, and Void Stranger notes.
9. Loads, sizes, and positions OBS with settings to enable my PNGTuber avatar and some other stuff.
